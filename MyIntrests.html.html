<h2>  Drinking Coffee </h2> 
<p> <h3>I love drinking coffee, I love offering coffee to my friends and family. Also, If I meet new people in my life coffee will be my first introduce thing to them.

<h2> Hicking</h2> 
<p> <h3> I enjoy Hiking, before I become a mom I use to go every other week to enjoy nature, water, and fresh air. After I become a mom I have priority to take care of myself and my family and I don't seem to have the same time. However, every time I have the chance I will gladly take it. My last adventure was abungee jumping in the second legal highest bridge in the U.S. It was fun and scary. 
It's a cool place you should check them out.
