<p> <h2 style="text-align:center">Devolper Student</p><h2>
<p><h2 style="text-align:center"> Hello, My name is Zahraa Almayyahi (ZA-Ha-RA). I am a student In cloud development major at Edmonds College<p> I'm enjoying designing and creating new things, I love the idea of having to develop something into this world. I would like to be involved in creative work in the future.</p><p> I'm also interested in engineering, maybe to finish my bachelor's degree. 
I like to complete my work till the end and I enjoy things when I understand them. I also like Math and some physics. I'm using this opportunity to complete my degree without working a full-time job. </p></p>
<p> My past experience working with Aerospace companies and building airplanes. I loved my jobs creating future products, some of them won't be done until 5 years in the future. I was also honored to work on the first airplane of the  777x.<p> I made a lot of small changes to the electric design and I helped my team to be safe and efficient. I was leading multiple projects to make my work area better. Working with engineers there made me want to complete my degree and go back. I don't know if I want to be in the same field but I know many gates will open up to me after i graduate. </p></p></h2>
